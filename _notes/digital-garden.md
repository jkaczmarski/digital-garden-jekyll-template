Here are some of my favourite digital gardens (some may not necessarily be considered digital gardens, but ...). A lot of what I have done on this site is based on their work. Please go and check them out. Got some suggestions for other digital gardens to check out? Let me know in the comments below ðŸ‘‡ or [email me](kaczmarski.joe@gmail.com) and I can add them to this list!
