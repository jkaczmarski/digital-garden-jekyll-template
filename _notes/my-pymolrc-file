title: How I set up my pymolrc file
---


As a structural biologist and protein engineer, I spend a significant amount of time looking at protein structures on my computer. I use a number of different programs to view molecular structures depending on the task at hand (e.g. ChimeraX when [[using ISOLDE for low resolution structures]], Maestro when using the Schrodinger Suite, VMD when trying to get certain render styles or viewing MD trajectories), but my go-to program on a day-to-day basis is definitely PyMol. Because I spend so much time working in PyMol, there are certain ways that I like to set up the GUI, custom keyboard shortcuts I like to use, and python scripts that I run regularly. The day I discovered the .pymolrc file (where all these kinds of custom settings are stored) was a life-changing day.

Working as a research scientist, it is sometimes nice to get a bit of positive feedback every now and again. I have set up my PyMol to tell me how awesome I am at the end of the .pymolrc file.

## What is in my current .pymolrc file?
