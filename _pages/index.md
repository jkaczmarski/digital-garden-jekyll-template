# 👋 Hi, I'm Joe Kaczmarski

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- [[About me]]<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- [[My Research Interests]]<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- [[My Publications]]<br>
</p>

🌱 Welcome to my [[digital garden]] - a space where, over the coming years, I plan to grow my thoughts and writings about life and science. My garden has only just started, so you might want to come back later when there is more to see here.

Because my garden will be continuously growing, you will likely find that some of the notes are only seedlings (the beginnings of ideas or pieces of writing), while others are more established. As you pass through my garden, you may even find some [[unlinked phrases]] - these are things I hope to write about soon, so please come back and check on their development later. Feel free to wander through my notes by following the links that are scattered throughout these pages or if, like me, you are more of a visual person, you can explore all my notes (and how they connect) using the knowledge graph at the bottom of this page.  

My digital garden will be roughly divided into two main plots:

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
  🧪 <span style="font-weight: bold">[[Science]]</span>  <br>
  Jump into my thoughts on science, where I share thoughts on life as a research scientist, [[my favourite lab hacks]], and [[notes on the research articles that I have been reading]] or [[writing]].<br><br>
  Here's a few of my favourite topics to write about:<br>  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- [[Lab Hacks]]<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- [[Ancestral protein reconstruction]]<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- [[Protein engineering]]<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- [[Structural Immunology]]<br>
</p>

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
  <span style="font-weight: bold">🧗🏻‍ [[Life]]</span><br>
  Where I share my notes on things outside of the field of science (if there is such a thing??), including [[notes on books I have read]], [[my personal projects]], and other random goodies.<br><br>
  Here's a few of my favourite topics to write about:<br>  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- [[Note-taking]]<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- [[My Projects]]<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- [[My Book Notes]]<br>
